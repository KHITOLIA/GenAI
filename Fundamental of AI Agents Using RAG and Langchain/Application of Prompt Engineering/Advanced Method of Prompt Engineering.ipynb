       "' Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions by analyzing data, without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow systems to automatically improve their performance in a specific task over time, by learning from large amounts of data. The goal of machine learning is to enable machines to perform tasks that would require human-like intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding images, making decisions, or predicting outcomes. Machine learning algorithms are used in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and data mining, among others. They can be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each of these categories has different applications and uses different types of data to learn and make predictions or decisions.'"

      "3. To find the time taken for the stone to return to its initial point, you can use the equation for constant acceleration with initial velocity (v0) equal to zero: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity (zero since it returns to the initial point), a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time. Rearranging for t gives t = v / a.\n",
